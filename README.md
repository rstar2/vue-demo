# Vue simple playground demos

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## The project is also hosted in GitLab and has CI/CD set using the .gitlab-ci.yml

So it has a 'pages' stage that deploys it to static hosting

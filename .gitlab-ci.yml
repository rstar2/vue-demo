# 'pages' is a special job that is used to upload static content to GitLab
# that can be used to serve your website. It has a special syntax,
# so the two requirements below must be met:
#   1. Any static content must be placed under a public/ directory
#   2. artifacts with a path to the public/ directory must be defined
pages:
  stage: deploy
  only:
    - master
  script:
    - npm run build
    - mv dist public
    # - cp -r dist/* public
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public
